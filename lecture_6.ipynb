Initially, I was living in an old traditional hut, grass-thatched which was always leaking during rains. Though I desired to upgrade to an iron-roofed house like my fellow villagers, I couldn't afford to purchase even a single item, since the money I had was little compared to the vast family needs. Having a decent house, spacious and iron-roofed is the biggest difference in my daily life. I am grateful to GiveDirectly for helping me to achieve this dream.\"\n",

I built a decent timber wall house  for them as a gift and it's my happiness to help through this rite of passage of their life and I felt building a house for them will show my appreciation as well . Secondly ,I am now a proud owner of a dairy cow and  I can always rely on it as a future investment mostly in case of a financial crisis in my family.
