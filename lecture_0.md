### Disclaimers

- You are not going to be good at coding by the end of this class
- I am here to teach you to:
  - Understand the power of code
  - Not be afraid of code
  - Troubleshoot
  - Google stuff
- Not a statistician
- This class came together in two weeks
  - Rough around the edges
  - Subject to change
  - Ask for your patience

## Spreadsheets vs. programming languages

### Why spreadsheets

- The easy stuff is easy
- Lots of people know how to use them
- Mostly just have to point, click, and scroll
- Data and logic live together as one

### Why programming languages

- Data and logic _don't_ live together
  - Why might this matter?
- More powerful, flexible, and expressive than spreadsheet formulas

  - Don't have to cram into a single line

    ```
    =SUM(INDEX(C3:E9,MATCH(B13,C3:C9,0),MATCH(B14,C3:E3,0)))
    ```

  - Can have more descriptive data references than `Sheet1!A:A`

- Better at working with large data
  - Google Sheets and Excel have hard limits at 1-5 million rows, but get slow long before that
- Reusable code (packages)
- Automation

### Side-by-side\*

|                       Task |  Spreadsheets  | Programming languages |
| -------------------------: | :------------: | :-------------------: |
|           **Loading data** |      Easy      |        Medium         |
|           **Viewing data** |      Easy      |        Medium         |
|         **Filtering data** |      Easy      |        Medium         |
|      **Manipulating data** |     Medium     |        Medium         |
|           **Joining data** |      Hard      |        Medium         |
| **Complicated transforms** | Impossible\*\* |        Medium         |
|             **Automation** | Impossible\*\* |        Medium         |
|        **Making reusable** | Impossible\*\* |        Medium         |
|         **Large datasets** |   Impossible   |         Hard          |

_\*Ratings are obviously somewhat subjective._

_\*\*Not including scripting._

## Python vs. other languages

- Good for general-purpose _and_ data stuff
- Widely used in both industry and academia
- Relatively easy to learn
- Open source
