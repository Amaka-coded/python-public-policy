## Spreadsheets vs. Python vs. Pandas

| Task                        | Spreadsheets      | Python               | Pandas |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ------ |
| Loading data                | Just click!       |                      |
| Viewing data                | File->Open/Import | <code>print()</code> |
| Filtering data              |                   |                      |
| Manipulating data           |                   |                      |
| Joining data                |                   |                      |
| Automation                  |                   |                      |
| Working with large datasets |                   |                      |
| Making reusable             |                   |                      |

### Why spreadsheets

- Lots of people know how to use them
- The data and the logic live together as one

### Why Python

- The data and the logic _don't_ live together
  - Why might this matter?
- More powerful, flexible, and expressive than spreadsheet formulas
  - Don't have to cram into a single line!
- Better at working with large data
  - Google Sheets and Excel have hard limits at 1-5 million rows, but get slow long before that
- Reusable code (packages)
- Automation

## Python vs. other languages

- Good for general-purpose _and_ data stuff
- Widely used in both industry and academia
- Relatively easy to learn
- Open source
